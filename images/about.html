        When it was introduced, the 1959 Triumph Bonneville 650 was one of, if not THE fastest motorcycles you could buy.
        It was a real hot rod! The new T120 designation is supposed to suggest that it could do 120 mph! Actual road tests
        done by motorcycle magazines of the day topped-out a box-stock, 59 Bonnie at 108 mph. Not quite 120, but very fast
        for 1959! This was the only year with no letter designation after the T120.

            The Triumph Bonneville T120 boasts a timeless and iconic body design that seamlessly blends classic aesthetics with modern engineering.
             Distinguished by its gracefully contoured fuel tank, the T120 exudes a sense of heritage reminiscent of its 1950s predecessor. The flowing
              lines of the motorcycle's frame accentuate its retro appeal, housing a 1200cc parallel-twin engine that not only delivers robust 
              performance but also serves as a focal point of the bike's visual allure. A sculpted and comfortable saddle complements the overall 
              design, offering a distinctive silhouette that defines the Bonneville T120. The attention to detail extends to the meticulously crafted 
              chrome accents, spoked wheels, and elegantly styled exhaust, contributing to the motorcycle's character and charm. With a commitment to 
              maintaining the spirit of the original Bonneville, the T120's body design is a harmonious fusion of classic styling and contemporary functionality,
               creating a motorcycle that captivates riders with its timeless beauty and evocative presence.
