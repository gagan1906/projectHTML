        <p ><strong>Triumph 1959 Bonneville</strong> was &nbsp launched in 1959 and there are 7<br>
            different models &nbsp that has&nbsp been launhed since 1959. Its launchng<br> 
            price was 2,499 CAD, which wa quite high according to that era, but<br>
            as comparision to its specifications &nbsp the price was nothing infront of <br>
            it. Shocking fact was the only 375 &nbsp units <strong>Triumph 1959 Bonneville</strong><br>
            were made till made 1970, after that its production  was stopped due<br>
            to the launching of its newer models.

            <p>The <strong>Triumph 1959 Bonneville</strong> was Edward Turner's last production<br>
                 design at Triumph (in retirement Turner designed the Triumph Bandit/<br>&nbspBSA Fury which 
                did not pass &nbspthe prototype stage &nbspbefore BSA went <br>under). The new motorcycle was
                conceived and developed so quickly <br>that it was not included
                in the 1959 Triumph catalogue. With a 649 cc <br>(39.6 in3) parallel-twin &nbsp(two-cylinder) 
                engine the T120 was based on <br>the Triumph Tiger T110 
                and was fitted with the Tiger's &nbsp optional twin 1 <br>3/16 in AmalMonobloc carburettors as
                 standard,along with that model's <br>high-performance &nbsp inlet
                camshaft. Launched in 1959 &nbspby Triumph as <br>"The Best Motorcycle in the World", the Bonneville 
                T120 was aimed <br>mainly at the lucrative US market
                where enthusiasts were demanding <br>extra performance.

            <p>Initially produced with a pre-unit construction engine which <br>enabled the bike to &nbsp achieve 115 mph (185 km/h) without<br> further 
                modification, the power tended to induce high speed<br> wobbles from the single downtube frame,[4] so in 1963 a sti<br>ffer and more 
                compact unit construction model was introdu-<br>ced, with additional bracing at the steering head and swingi<br> arm.[4] The 
                steering angle was altered and improved forka <br>ffer and more 
                compact unit construction model was introdu-<br>ced, with additional bracing at the steering head and swging<br>s were fitted a couple of years later, which, together with the<br> increased stiffness
                 enabled overall performance to match <br>that of the Bonneville's rivals.
