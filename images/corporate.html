          <div class="text2">        The origins of Triumph can be traced back to 1885 when a German immigrant named Siegfried Bettmann founded S. Bettmann & Co. in London. Initially, the company imported bicycles from Europe. In 1887, Moritz Schulte joined Bettmann, and the company name was changed to Bettmann & Schulte. The first Triumph-branded bicycles were produced in 1889.<br>
